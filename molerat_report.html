	The link titled "Research for this project" contains initial research for the project including a time line. Due to time contraints, I couldn't add as many pages as I would have liked which could be work done in the future. This site was meant to be a site for providing information about naked mole rats, so more information can be added as well as research. Also if more time was allowed, I would have liked to polish the site more and improve the aethestics. For the most part I stuck to the time line, but like I mentioned earlier I could not add as much as I would have liked to due to the time constraint and having to dedicate time to other classes and obligations.
