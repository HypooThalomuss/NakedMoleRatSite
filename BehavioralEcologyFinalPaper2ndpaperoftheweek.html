They are members of the Bathyergidae family, which consists of blesmols and mole rats. Species in this family are burrowers that can dig underground, and rely on primarily their sense of touch to navigate due to their poor eyesight and lack of light in their underground habitat (Myers, n.d.). Despite being called &ldquo;mole rats&rdquo;, the naked mole rat is more closely related to guinea pigs, chinchillas, and porcupines than to either moles or rats (San Diego Zoo, n.d.).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sets </span><span class="c9">H. glaber</span><span>&nbsp;apart from most other organisms is the naked mole rats&rsquo; social structure. Species in the Bathygridae family can have varying social structures depending on the species. However, naked mole rats are not only one of the few species in the family, but are also one of the very few mammals that are eusocial. (Faulkes et al, 1997). Eusociality is considered the highest degree of sociality and an extreme version of altruism, or acts that are selfless that put the needs of others before those of the individual that acted. A species is considered to show eusociality if they live in a colony or group where workers help care for offspring produced by those able to reproduce (Animal Behavior/Sociality, n.d.). In the case of the naked mole rat, only the queen and a few chosen males are able to reproduce. All of the other mole rats in the colony have various jobs such as gathering and burrowing, and serve the colony to help care for the offspring. Whether it is investment in non-descendent offspring, foraging for food, predator avoidance, communication and intraspecific competition, or their mating system, much of </span><span class="c9">H. glaber</span><span class="c2">&rsquo;s behavior is profoundly impacted by its unique social structure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Foraging and Dispersal:</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">The naked mole rat can be found exclusively in underground burrows in eastern Africa. However, the soil in eastern Africa can be extremely hard to burrow through due to the arid climate (Bennet &amp; Faulkes, 2005, p. 47). In order for the naked mole rat to be able to dig through this soil, they along with other mole rat species in the Bathygidrae family, have large teeth or &ldquo;incisors&rdquo; that they use to burrow that are situated outside of their mouth in order to prevent soil from entering their mouths when they dig (Bennett &amp; Faulkes, 2005, p. 37). The primary food source of naked mole rats are geophytes, which are plants with storage organs or buds underground, making them easily accessible for the subterranean naked mole rat and not very coveted by other species above ground. Along with their incisors which are able to bite through the plants with ease, they also have an immunity to toxins from the plants&rsquo; natural line of defense. That combined with the fact that these plants are available year round makes them even more of an exclusive food source to the naked mole rat. (Bennett &amp; Faulkes, 2005, p. 53).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plants are a vital food source for naked mole rats and are often larger in size in their habitat of eastern Africa. However, the aridity of the climate poses two challenges naked mole rats must overcome in order to find food effectively. One is that the soil is harder to dig through due to the lack of moisture in the climate. Living in colonies allows individual naked mole rats to work with other naked mole rats to dig in a group so that each individual doesn&rsquo;t have to expend as much energy navigating underground. Despite the added benefits of digging in a group, naked mole rats will avoid digging if the soil is too hard to even dig through or if the soil too fluid (Bennett &amp; Faulkes, pg. 47). Something to note is that despite the tendency of naked mole rats to avoid digging in extremely dry soil, when they dig in moist soil, naked mole rats tend to experience more energy costs than digging dryer soil. However, when digging in moist soil, naked mole rats can dig with a greater efficiency and at greater speed. It is because of this that naked mole rats tend to dig more after it has rained and prefer to dig when the soil is moist (Bennett &amp; Faulkes, pg. 48).</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">The second challenge is that vegetation in the region, including tubers, are scattered across great distances from each other. This results in an increased likelihood of unsuccessful foraging attempts, especially in solitary species. Living in colonies also helps to solve this problem by &nbsp;increasing the number of foraging attempts that can be performed which also increases the likelihood of successful foraging attempts (Faulkes et. al, 1997).</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span>Examining patterns of behavior across the Bathygidrae family suggest that foraging efficiency may be particularly important factor in the evolution of eusociality in </span><span class="c9">H. glaber</span><span>&nbsp;and other species as a function of the area of Africa they inhabit. For instance, the only other species in the Bathyergidae family that is eusocial is the Damaraland mole rat (</span><span class="c9">Fukomys damarensis).</span><span>&nbsp;They are endemic to southern Africa which has an arid climate like the home of the naked mole rats: east Africa (Faulkes et. al, 1997). On the other hand, one of the species that is most closely related to the naked mole rat is the silvery mole rat (</span><span class="c9">Helieophobius argenteoconerus)</span><span class="c2">. Unlike the Damaraland and naked mole rats, the silvery mole rats are solitary and are endemic to the area of east Africa below the habitat of the naked mole rat. This includes countries like Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mozambique. This area, unlike the areas where the Damaraland and naked mole rats reside, are less arid and with greater rainfall. This means that there is more vegetation in this region and food is more densely distributed (Silvery Mole Rat, n.d.).</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further research into the conditions under which individuals from a naked mole rat colony disperse to found a new colony could shed further light on the role of foraging efficiency in the evolution of eusociality. Dispersal would be predicted to be more likely to occur as a function of the relationship between colony size and local resources, with greater dispersal as the colony size becomes too large for the available resources. Furthermore, dispersal distances would also be predicted to vary with colony size and available resources, favoring further dispersal from larger colonies, with fewer local resources. While these elements of naked mole rat dispersal have yet to be examined in sufficient detail, some elements of dispersal behavior have been studied.</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">New naked mole rat colonies are formed by mole rat &ldquo;dispersers&rdquo; that travel far from their previous colony above ground to find a place underground to start a colony. Dispersers seem to be heavier in weight which is likely due to them storing energy to be used to travel and start a colony. These dispersers tend to move above ground during the night in order to reduce the chances of being predated. While there are cases where dispersers join pre-existing colonies, they are more likely to make a new colony (Stanton, 2000). While the exact mechanism that naked mole rat dispersers use to find each other isn&rsquo;t certain, it is likely that they find each other by following animal tracks where they dig holes to the surface in order to signal they are looking for a mate. There has also been some evidence that lone females kick up feces and urine-soaked soil from underground in order to signal to lone males that she is looking for a mate. One a certain number of individuals have gathered (the exact number is unknown), a new colony is formed and more distinct groups are formed the more individuals there are (Stanton, 2000).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Predator Defense:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high level of organization in a mole rat colony. Not only are there individuals who go out and forage for food, but there are also individuals who defend the colony and the territory from predators. For the most part, predation on the naked mole rat is very low due to the colony living underground with any entrances to their tunnel system usually blocked. However, predation can occur during certain times of the year and by certain predators, with their main predators being snakes (Brett, 1986, pg. 306). If a naked mole rat is captured by a predator, it can emit grunts which are then emitted by other members of the colony to notify them to seal off the entrance that the predator used in order to prevent more mole rats from being captured (Brett, 1986, pg. 310). &nbsp;Also, mole rats tend to produce mole hills (entrances to the tunnels) in the early morning or late evening in order to coincide with when predators are sleeping to reduce the chances of successful predation (Brett, 1986, 312).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three main snake predators of the naked mole rat include the </span><span class="c9">Rhamphiophis oxyrhynchus rostratus</span><span>&nbsp;(rufous beaked snake), </span><span class="c9">Mehelya capensis savorgnani</span><span>&nbsp;(file snake), and the </span><span class="c9">Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia hotamboeia</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(white-lipped snake). Strategies of naked mole predation may vary depending on the snake. For instance, the rufous snake primarily prey on naked mole rats during the rainy season when the soil would be looser (Brett, 1986, pg. 307). There have been instances of the snake species attacking from above as the mole rats are burrowing underground, but they have also been able to infiltrate the tunnel system and attack mole rats with their venom via biting (Brett, 1986, pg. 308).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an intruder such as a snake or an individual from a different colony is seen approaching or has entered the tunnels, the worker or individual emits an audible alarm to signal colony soldiers to come and defend the colony. They block the intruder&rsquo;s path by piling on top of each other so that the intruder is exposed to the soldiers&rsquo; teeth and would either have to turn around or try their luck. Once a predator is dealt with, the entrance is resealed to prevent another intruder from entering the same entrance (San Diego Zoo, n.d.).</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Intraspecific Competition &amp; Communication:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intraspecies competition in a naked mole rat colony sharply increases when a new queen has to be chosen. The queen of a colony is typically the most aggressive member of the colony and is able to suppress the maturity and reproductive abilities of workers, allowing only her and a few chosen males to be able to reproduce. However when the queen is removed, all of the females in the colony are able to regain their fertility and have the potential to become the new queen (Clarke &amp; Faulkes, 1997). During this period of instability, the female mole rats engage in combat with each other that either end in death or when one female backs down. The female that wins is considered of a higher standing and is more likely to become queen. However, a queen is not solidified until that female produces and gives birth to offspring. Not only does she have to give birth to become queen, but she must also continue to produce offspring in order to stay queen and establish her dominance. Once a queen is established, all the other females once again have their fertility suppressed until the queen is overthrown again. Once this suppression occurs, conflict within the colony decreases drastically and life in the colony goes back to business as usual (Solly, 2018). There is little evidence that indicates any intraspecies competition between females during an active queen&rsquo;s reign, or in general, within the colony, likely due to the established dominance of the queen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the naked mole rat, the eusocial Damaraland mole rat also has one queen who is the only female able to reproduce, as well as males chosen by the female. They also share the behavior that the queen suppresses the reproductivity of other females likely through aggressive behaviors and pheromones (Clarke et. al, 2001). Both the Damaraland mole rat and naked mole rat have identical colony structures with little evidence of any differences between the two such as one not having increased competition when a new queen must be chosen. However, there was much more information discussing this in naked mole rats than in Damaraland mole rats, so a full comparison would be extremely difficult. Due to their structural similarities though, it is likely that there is little, if not no, difference between the two when it comes to how a queen is chosen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Mating System &amp; Sexual Selection:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most members of the colony are not able to reproduce. The only colony members that are able to produce offspring are the queen and 1-3 chosen males. The lucky few mole rats that are able to reproduce are the highest ranking members of the colony with the queen on top. The queen chooses the males to mate with according to their dominance ranking in the colony, along with their body size, and their age. Males that are bigger and older tend to be higher in the colony ranks and have a higher chance of being chosen by the queen to be able to mate (Clarke &amp; Faulkes, 1998).</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">While there is little research into exactly how a male is chosen or traits that a queen looks for when choosing males, it is likely that she chooses males based on their dominance since it is the dominant individuals (male or female) that are able to reproduce. Dominance is established through aggressive behaviors such as shoving and biting. The more aggressive behaviors an individual shows, the more dominance is established and maintained. When a new queen is chosen, new males are chosen as well, meaning that anyone in the colony, male or female, has the possibility of being able to reproduce. This means that during breeding, males and females tend to be more aggressive so they could possibly be able to reproduce. In the wild, breeding occurs once a year (Hagan, 2013).</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">As previously mentioned, the eusocial Damaraland mole rat also has a structure where only one female and the only chosen male is able to reproduce.. Overall, their reproductive behaviors are very similar to the naked mole rat. The Damaraland mole rat breeds once a year in the wild and the reproductive individuals suppress the non-reproductive individuals and the reproductive individuals act aggressively to establish and maintain dominance (Goddard, 2005). However, unlike the naked mole rat, the Damaraland mole rat queen only has one chosen male while the naked mole rat can have 1-3 chosen males, making the Damaraland mole rat monogamous and the naked mole rat polyandrous. This however seems to be the only main difference between the two because their social structure remains very similar. The breeding pair does little work within the colony while the workers perform the parental care such as gathering food for the offspring and breeding pair (Goddard, 2005). These variations in chosen males is likely due to the Damaraland mole rat having a smaller average colony size ( up to 25 individuals) (Damaraland Mole Rats, n.d.). This shows that it&rsquo;s likely that while exact numbers of individuals in each species may vary, the overall structure is consistent, indicating that the structure is consistent with a eusocial structure, at least in mammals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Parental Investment &amp; Social Behavior:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked mole rats have one of the most complex social structures of all the mammals. The highest ranking members of the colony are the queen and her chosen males to mate with. These individuals tend to be more aggressive, especially the queen. This allows the queen to reproductively suppress the workers, allowing her to be the only female able to reproduce in the colony (Clarke &amp; Faulkes, 1997). Because very few individuals are able to produce offspring, there is low genetic diversity in a colony and inbreeding is very likely. The workers in a colony are often helping to raise a sibling or at least a close genetic relative (Smithsonian Zoo, 2019).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the other naked mole rats in the colony that are unable to reproduce are the workers. Unlike the distinction between reproductive and non-reproductive members of the colony, distinction amongst workers is less obvious since the duties workers perform are interchangeable. In other words, each individual worker can do different jobs in their lifetime such as burrowing or foraging (Social Structure of Naked Mole Rats, 2006). However, there is evidence that individual body size plays a part in what duty each worker tends to perform. For example, smaller workers tend to perform duties such as food transfer, soil transport, and collection of nest materials. While larger individuals would be more involved in duties requiring more strength such as volcanoing (burrowing into the ground), new tunnel construction, and defending the colony against intruding mole rats and predators. There is also some evidence that younger mole rats start working at a certain age, but then work less frequently to conserve their energy in case they need to fight off invaders, but then work more frequently as they get to an older age. Overall, colonies have an average of about 80 mole rats, but colonies as big as 300 mole rats have been found (Social Structure of Naked Mole Rats, 2006). Another interesting thing is that workers that burrow underground do so in teams ranging from 2 to 8 individuals. The individual at the front digs using their incisors while other individuals behind them pass the dirt further into the back so that no one has to actually eat the dirt (Brett, 1986, pg. 150).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked mole rats have a queen that is the sole female able to reproduce along with few select males. All of the other mole rats are individuals and work for their queen and the offspring in a colony. They are able to work together to get enough food for the entire colony and defend it, all while completely underground. This is quite significant because this kind of colony set up is much more common in insects and bugs (Plowes, 2010). </span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span>While insects and naked mole rats are both eusocial and live in colonies, the structure of the colonies can differ. For example, in chimney bee colonies (</span><span class="c9">Anthophora abrupta</span><span class="c2">), the job of the individual is determined by their age as opposed to the naked mole rats&rsquo; being determined by body size. For instance, young worker bees are primarily in the central part of the hive where they care for the brood and tend to the queen. As the worker bees get older, they start to work in the outer regions of the hive, performing tasks such as building comb, receiving and storing nectar and pollen, foraging, protecting the hive, and removing dead bees from the hive. (Mortensen et. al, 2019). Another key difference is that the queen in a bee colony is born a queen and remains a queen, while the queen in a naked mole rat colony earns her title by establishing dominance and sometimes through combat (Mortensen et. al, 2019).</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2">No matter the species, eusociality allows a species to be granted a great survival advantage since it is a lot easier to survive in a group as opposed to living alone. The mole rats need this advantage in order to survive in the arid regions of eastern and southern Africa. It was stated earlier that the main reason that naked mole rats and Damaraland mole rats have adopted eusociality and colony living is primarily to be able to dig through the soil and forage enough food despite challenges posed by living in an arid climate. </span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span>Eusocial bugs are found all over the world, not just in arid climates. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that other organisms don&rsquo;t have similar reasons for adopting eusociality. For instance, </span><span class="c9">Synalpheus</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;shrimp are eusocial marine shrimp that live in groups composed of hundreds of individuals, acting as parasites on tropical sponges. These host sponges are not evenly distributed and often distributed far away from each other, so it is a popular theory that these shrimp became eusocial in order to better disperse and make new colonies at a lower risk than remaining in the nest (Plowes, 2010).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20 c21">Conclusion:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked mole rats have an extremely complex social structure that impacts every other aspect of their behavior. They are eusocial and live in colonies of 70-80 individuals with the only individuals able to reproduce are the female queen and 1-3 males chosen by the queen. All other individuals are workers or soldiers. Workers gather food, mainly tubers, and bring them back to the colony, as well as tend to the offspring that may not be their offspring specifically, but is likely their sibling or close relative due to the high amount of inbreeding since only a few individuals are able to reproduce. Soldiers are often larger than the regular workers and defend the colony from invaders by piling up on top of each other, blocking the intruder&rsquo;s path, and exposing their powerful teeth to the predator. The queen is the most aggressive colony member since unlike many bug colonies, mole rat queens are chosen through combat and her dominance solidifies through aggressive behavior. The queen even suppressed the maturation of other females through aggressive behavior and pheromones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eusociality in the naked mole rats likely evolved at least in part to provide optimal foraging efficiency. They are endemic to eastern Africa where it is extremely arid. This means that it is extremely hard to dig through the soil and to find food since vegetation has an extremely patchy distribution. Eusociality allows naked mole rats to have enough of an advantage to not only be able to get food for themselves, but also for the rest of the colony while ensuring their genes are passed on if not by the individual themselves, but helping care for offspring produced by the queen which is often actually a close relative. Working in groups increases the chance for successful foraging and improves their ability to fight off predators since a group of naked mole rats are a lot more intimidating than a single individual a predator like a snake can easily consume.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little evidence to suggest with certainty how eusociality came to be. What seems to be the case in not only naked mole rats, but other species as well, is that the individuals start to enjoy a benefit they are only able to reap when they&rsquo;re in a group and they keep going from there. In the case of both naked mole rats and the only other eusocial animal (Damaraland mole rat), it is the ability to gather a sufficient amount of food despite being in a less forgiving climate, and even thrive while doing it.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">REFERENCES</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Animal Behavior/Sociality.
