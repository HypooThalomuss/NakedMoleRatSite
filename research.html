<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>What is the website about?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The website will focus on the social structure of naked mole rats. More specifically, it will be about the colony structure of the naked mole rat and how that helps it to survive in various aspects such as predator defense, mating, etc.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What is its purpose (can be more than one)?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					 The research for this site will be based off of the research I did for a previous class, this website will just allow me to put this research into a form more digestable than a research paper. This can hopefully allow people to learn information from research in a way they can better understand and in a more visually appealling way.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Who is the target audience?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The audience will be whoever wants to know information about the naked mole rat. These people can include students needing to do research for school, scientists gathering sources for research, or anyone in general who would like to know.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What does the target audience want from the website?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The target audience would want this website to contain information about what the website is saying it has, namely information about the social sturcture of the naked mole rat. Also the audience would want to know sources that the information is based off of to prove the content isn't made up or plagarized. Another thing the target audience would want from the website is for the information to be shown in a way that is clear, cohesive, and overall more digestable than a long, boring research paper.
				</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
</p>
<h2>Competative Research</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Are there other websites on your topic?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There are other websites with general information about the naked mole rat. Most of them are from academic sites such as university sites and mueseums such as the Smithsonian as well as zoos.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What are other sites doing? What are they sucessful at? What are they unsuccessful at?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					These other websites are good at seperating the information into categories (mating, dietary habits, social structure, etc). A lot of them are also good at making the page at least somewhat visually appealing so that people can go to the site and not be completely overwhelmed like they would with an academic research paper. However, a lot of them just deliver this information in text form, and depending on how much information there is, it could still be so much raw text that it turns the reader off, especially students or anyone who may not be used to or into academic readings.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>How can your site be better or different from the competitors?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					My site could contain more type of content than just text. While a lot of it will probably be text due to the subject being research, I could include other forms that will make the website more digestable especially to the genral reader. This could include videos, pictures/diagrams, etc.
